                        and securely. This article will help you answer questions and troubleshoot common problems with your 
                        Windows 10 update.

                    <p style="font-size:20px;color:white">Windows 10 requires certain requirements 
                    to run on a pc Just as with space requirements, 
                    your PC will also have to be capable of running 
                    Windows 10. This means that it must reach certain 
                    minimum system requirements. The requirements for 
                    running Windows 10 are relatively low: A processor 
                    of 1GHz or faster; 1GB (32-bit) or 2GB (64-bit) of 
                    RAM; 30GB of free drive space; Microsoft DirectX 9 
                    graphic device; and a Microsoft account combined 
                    with internet access. To find out your PC's spec, 
                    go to the Control Panel and select System and Security, 
                    then System. However, keep in mind that these are the m
                    inimum requirements, and you should shoot for higher specs 
                    to have a smooth and enjoyable experience.</p>

                    When you install Windows 10 onto a new pc you would assume it would be a clean install, 
                    but Microsoft has decided to put ads in Windows 10. 
                    These programs which run in the background could impact performance of your PC and make it slow. 
                    To remove these programs Microsoft has put in place you will need to 
                    follow some simple steps to get rid of them. Go to windows start menu type 
                    in “Windows Powershell  Admin'' click it and you will see a blue command box 
                    which is where you will type in the following command  
                    “Get-AppxPackage APPLICATION_NAME | Remove-AppxPackage'' 
                    these will perform the command and start deleting the pre installed application.</p>

                        Windows 10 is, in many ways, a truly internet based operating system. Mostly, 
                        this is a bonus but there are times when it isn't and 
                        Microsoft's attitude towards operating system updates 
                        is one such time The most annoying part of automatic 
                        updates is the restarting, which can seemingly come at 
                        random and inconvenient times. The simplest way to counteract 
                        this is to head to Windows Update in Settings > Update & Security, 
                        click on Advanced Options and then Notify to Schedule Restart, 
                        which means the OS will request a reboot instead of interrupting 
                        everything you’re working on.
